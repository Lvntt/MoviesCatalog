# MoviesCatalog

MoviesCatalog is a project that was made as a laboratory work of the 2nd module (of the 2nd year) while studying in TSU, HITs.
The app provides the following functionality:
+ Viewing the movie catalog
+ Viewing some movie's details
+ Leaving a review for some movie
+ Managing user's favorite movies list
+ Managing user's profile

The application UI was made based on a [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/YItWDHRSilOE6pjngqrLB7/MovieCatalog--2023?type=design&node-id=0-1&mode=design&t=teJNzPL3WlWsgIxC-0) file that was provided to all the students.
